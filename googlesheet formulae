Working on name column

Removing Special Characters in the name column
=REGEXREPLACE(B2, "[^a-zA-Z0-9\s]", "")


Counting to see if there are blanks in a column
=COUNTBLANK(D:D)


Replacing blanks with Unknown
=IF(ISBLANK(B3), "UNKNOWN", B3)

=IF(OR(ISBLANK(INDIRECT("B" & ROW())), INDIRECT("B" & ROW()) = ""), "UNKNOWN", INDIRECT("B" & ROW()))

To fill empty spaces with unknown
=IF(LEN(TRIM(F2))=0, "UNKNOWN", F2)



Removing Leading or Trailing spaces
=TRIM(A1)


To fill empty spaces with unknown
=IF(LEN(TRIM(F2))=0, "UNKNOWN", F2)

Checking for duplicates in id column
Done by using conditional formatting with the rule =COUNTIF(A:A, A1) > 1

This formula sees whether there are special characters and labels it as TRUE if there are and FALSE if there are not
=REGEXMATCH(TRIM(CLEAN(B1)), "[^a-zA-Z0-9 ]")

This formula counts the number of TRUE to know the number of cells with special characters. =COUNTIF(D:D, TRUE)


This formula checks if the cell in column O is empty, and if it is, it fills the cell with "01/01/1900" (a placeholder date); otherwise, it keeps the original date value. 
=IF(LEN(TRIM(O2))=0, DATE(1900, 1, 1), O2)
